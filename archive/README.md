## Deployment

Branches are automagically deployed to staging urls via now. Nowbot will comment on your branch when a deploy is complete with a URL to preview it at. Merges to master will auto swap over without downtime. For more info check out [Now.sh docs](https://now.sh). If you need organization access for other deployments, please contact @durfee.
