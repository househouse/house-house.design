// Styles
// ============================================================================
//
// Welcome to housecss! This functional CSS framework should be used as a
// foundation for you and your team to get set up and working on a project as
// quickly aspossible. Whether you are expanding housecss locally, or
// contributing back upstream to the housecss repo, we encourage you write CSS
// according our code guidelines and conventions:
//
// 1. Write SCSS (and CSS) as if someone is using it to learn how code. It
//    needs to be sensible and learnable for new front-end developers and
//    designers — everyone should be able to get going with housecss speedily.
//    We achieve this by writing well-documented code.
// 2. Housecss is content-agnostic, meaning HTML and CSS are completele separate
//    from one another. If you hide all styles from your template, the HTML
//    should be well-structured and semantically correct, formatted and arranged
//    in a logical hierarchy. That also means classes should be self-documenting
//    and independent of elements. The exception is components, which are
//    directly coupled to markup or other styles.
// 3. Follow the Code of Conduct at all times.
//
// Note: When contributing back upstream, compile your SCSS to CSS with:
//       sass --watch scss:css --style compact


// Settings
// ---
//
// Code that does not output CSS styles directly. This includes CSS custom
// properties, custom media queries, etc. Things like brand colours, modular
// spacing increments, and breakpoints are defined as variables here.

@import 'settings/variables';
@import 'settings/responsive';
@import 'settings/type-scale';


// Base
// ---
//
// Styles that target bare HTML elements. This mostly consists of a mixture of
// normalize.css and reset.css, and core typographic styles for things like
// headings, body text, and links which will rarely, if ever, change. No classes
// are defined here.

@import 'base/general';
@import 'base/typography';


// Utilities
// ---
//
// The bread and butter of our CSS. These are single-purpose, highly-reusable
// classes that do one thing extremely well. We have utilities for things like
// margins, padding, text alignment, display properties, positioning properties,
// and more. Utility classes use a u- namespace, e.g. u-bg-black.

@import 'utilities/appearance';
@import 'utilities/background';
@import 'utilities/border';
@import 'utilities/color';
@import 'utilities/display';
@import 'utilities/flex';
@import 'utilities/layout';
@import 'utilities/measure';
@import 'utilities/spacing';
@import 'utilities/text';


// 🤔 Where’s everything else?
// ============================================================================
//
// Components: Content-specific classes that generate distinct UI appearances.
// Styles should also (generally) be coupled to specific markup; if it is not
// directly related to any HTML, JS, or JSX, it should be considered a utility
// class (or series of classes.) Components use the c- namespace, e.g. c-logo.
//
// Views / templates: Sometimes, there are times that we need to write template
// overrides, or classes that are linked directly to the page on which they
// appear. These styles should be used as a last resort only!
//
// Third-party plugins and integrations often do not let us control their
// settings, or require us to override how they work. Toss those styles into
// individual partials below.
