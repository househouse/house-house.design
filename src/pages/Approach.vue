                p We‚Äôre organized a bit differently than the last agency you worked with, and we think that‚Äôs our biggest strength. With a tiny full-time staff and a big network, we can adapt to scale and changes ‚Äî just as your teams and projects do.

            p A think a small team like ours can make a big impact when you need it to. We take an iterative design approach to our work, meaning we communicating often, pivoting and adjusting until we get it right. This is a process; as we discover and learn more about you and your business goals, targets may sometime change. By designing iteratively, we can make sure things adapt gracefully along the way.

                p Some projects need one highly specialized designer, like a senior user experience researcher, while others may require the hands of many front-end developers.

                p When the tasks are tall, we‚Äôll rise to the challenge by bringing in our #[strong Housemates]. Our talented and trusted freelance friends can be an extra pair of hands needed to get the job done.

                p Some projects need a handful of specialists, like an information architect who has years of experience making sites for kids or a 3D animator who has extensive knowledge of the home improvement industry. Other projects call for an army of variously tenured folks, from junior-level production people to seasoned veterans who call the shots. For every project, we pull together the right people for the job.
