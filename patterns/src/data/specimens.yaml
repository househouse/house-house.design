  Though Lausanne is so near Geneva, its history, in historical times, has been
  widely different from that of the neighbouring town. Geneva enjoyed a modified
  independence from an early date, and became completely independent early in
  the sixteenth century. Lausanne, until nearly 300 years later, endured the
  domination, first of Savoy, and subsequently of Berne.
